📝 Usage
Basic Usage

```bash
from insta_bot import InstaBot

# Initialize bot
bot = InstaBot("your_username", "your_password")

# Login
if bot.login():
    # Run safe operations
    bot.run_safe_operations()
    
    # Show statistics
    print("\n--- Daily Statistics ---")
    for action, count in bot.action_counters['daily'].items():
        print(f"{action}: {count}/{bot.daily_limits[action]}")
```

Manual Actions


```bash
# Like a post
bot.safe_like("media_id_here")

# Follow a user
bot.safe_follow("user_id_here")

# Comment on a post
bot.safe_comment("media_id_here", "Great content!")

# View a story
bot.view_story("story_id_here")
```

Custom Engagement

```bash
# Run a hashtag engagement session
hashtags = ['python', 'coding', 'programming']
bot.smart_engagement_session(hashtags=hashtags, duration_minutes=20)

# View random stories
bot.view_random_stories(limit=15)

# Browse timeline
bot.browse_timeline(limit=25)
```

🔍 How It Works
1. Initialization

• Sets up logging and rate limits

• Loads previous action counters

• Configures client with realistic settings

2. Login Process

• Tries to load existing session

• Falls back to fresh login if needed

• Saves session for future use

• Verifies login with timeline fetch

3. Action Execution

• Checks if action is allowed (limits not exceeded)

• Adds human-like delay

• Executes the action

• Records the action

• Saves updated counters

4. Safety Checks

• Time-based restrictions

• Rate limit validation

• Error handling and recovery

• Session validation

⚡ Performance Tips

• Start Slow: Begin with lower limits to test

• Vary Activities: Mix different types of interactions

• Use Proxies: Consider using residential proxies (not included)

• Monitor Logs: Regularly check logs for errors

• Take Breaks: Don't run 24/7 - simulate human patterns

🚨 Common Issues & Solutions
Login Issues

• Problem: "LoginRequired" or "ChallengeRequired"

• Solution: Delete session.json and try fresh login

• Prevention: Enable 2FA on your account

Rate Limiting

• Problem: Actions stop working

• Solution: Check action_counters.json and wait for reset

• Adjustment: Lower the limits in setup_limits()

Account Safety

• Warning: Unusual activity detected

• Response: Stop bot immediately and wait 24-48 hours

• Prevention: Use conservative limits and normal hours

📈 Statistics Tracking

The bot automatically tracks:

• Daily action counts

• Hourly action counts

• Last reset times

• Session history

View statistics:

```bash
print(bot.action_counters['daily'])
print(bot.action_counters['hourly'])
```

🔧 Customization
Adjust Limits

```bash
def setup_limits(self):
    self.daily_limits = {
        'likes': 100,      # Reduced from 120
        'follows': 20,     # Reduced from 25
        # ... other limits
    }
```
Change Hashtags

```bash
def smart_engagement_session(self, hashtags=None, duration_minutes=30):
    if not hashtags:
        hashtags = ['your', 'custom', 'hashtags', 'here']
```

Modify Timing
```bash
def is_safe_time(self):
    # Custom time restrictions
    hour = datetime.now().hour
    # Allow 8AM-10PM only
    return 8 <= hour <= 22
```
